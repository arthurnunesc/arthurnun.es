# arthurnunesc-portfolio-website

This is the code for the first big improvement for my portfolio website. I'm documenting its development on my [Dev.to page](https://dev.to/arthurnunesc) and this is [the first post about it](https://dev.to/arthurnunesc/remaking-my-portfolio-website-204j).

Its design is already completed and you can take a look at it on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/mqFCogKxHtyjF7w5KeeEKS/arthurnunesc-Portfolio-Website?node-id=501%3A88&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=501%3A88).
